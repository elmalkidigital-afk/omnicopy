/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-generated content,
 * including product descriptions and credit transactions, is stored in subcollections under a user's
 * primary document. This ensures that users can only ever access data that belongs to them.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically under the `/users/{userId}` path. This
 * path-based security model is the cornerstone of the authorization logic, making it simple,
 * performant, and secure.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disabled: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly forbidden
 *   to protect user privacy and prevent data scraping.
 * - Strict Path-Based Ownership: All rules for subcollections rely on the `{userId}` wildcard from the
 *   path to grant access, ensuring a user can only operate within their own data tree.
 * - Default Deny: All operations are denied by default. Access is only granted through explicit
 *   `allow` statements.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The ruleset requires that any document created within a user's
 * data tree (e.g., a new product description) must contain a `userId` field that matches the
 * `{userId}` from the path. This denormalized field creates a verifiable link of ownership within the
 * document itself, which is enforced as immutable upon update.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The entire data model is segregated by user at the top level, which is the
 * most secure and performant way to manage private user data and enable secure `list` operations
 * within a user's own collections.
